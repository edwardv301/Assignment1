    <h3>How to Meditate</h3>

<div class="howtomeditate">
  <p>If you're interested in meditation, chances are you know a bit about meditation but you're still unsure as how to get started. Meditation is a pretty simple process but where do you begin? In this guide, we will give you everything you need to start your journey. </p>
  <p>For a beginner, meditation might feel a bit strange as it's a new experience. But don't worry as it's been a normal practice for a few thousand years. Before starting, it's best to figure out why you want to start and how you can achieve these goals. For example, maybe it's because you want to reduce stress and the way you'll achieve this goal is by meditating 5 minutes a day. Creating goals is a great way to keep you motivated and give you something to work for but keep in mind that goals or expectations aren't needed when it comes to meditation. </p>
  <h1>Get Started</h1>
  <p>To start your meditation practice, you don't need anything special. Just find a comfortable place to sit. Once you have that, start to slowly close your eyes. For beginners, we recommend that you first start <strong>focusing on your breath</strong> as it's always in the present moment. You can focus on how slow or fast your breathing, if the air is warm or cold that you're breathing, what other body parts are effected by your breath and so on. There really isn't a good or bad way to meditate so finding something that keeps your focus is always a start!</p>
  <p>You might notice that while meditating, you tend to lose your focus. That is perfectly fine and infact, it happens more often than you think. The moment you realize that you lost your focus, that's when you are fully aware and in the present moment. Slowly then bring your focus back to the breath. That's all you really have to do! </p>
  <p> If you read this far, I want you to try meditate for <strong>one minute</strong> to get familiar with the practice. </p>
  <p> Meditation is all about being aware of your mind and body. When you catch yourself thinking, try to just observe and detatch yourself from these thoughts. These thoughts are not you. The real you is when you're fully aware in the present moment. </p>
  <p> Meditation itself doesn't promsise to solve your problems or help you in any way. What meditation can do is change your views and feelings to situations happening around you as the only thing you can change is yourself, not anyone or anything else. </p>

  <h1>Frequent Questions</h1>
  <p><strong>How long should I meditate for?</strong><br>
    How long you meditate is completely up to you as it all depends on your lifestyle and the amount of time you want to set for your practice. For starting out, we recommend you start meditating for 5-10 minutes at a time. If you start feel it's too short, try 15 or even 20 minutes. </p>
  <p><strong>There are too many distractions when I meditate, what should I do?</strong><br>
    Many people believe that in order to meditate, your environment needs to be completely quiet and your mind needs to be still. It's good to know that this isn't needed when meditating. Infact, you should try focus on your distractions and describe what they sound like. Are they loud? Where are they coming from? Is there a rhythm to them? You could also just acknowledge the sounds and let them come and go as they please. </p>
  <p><strong>What other types of meditations are there?</strong><br>
    There are many types of meditions out there for you to try. It all comes down to preference. For beginners, we recommened guided meditations, focused attention meditation and Visualization meditations. Of course there are many more but for now, these should be enough. </p>
  <p>Guided meditations is when a teacher guides you through the meditation practice. This is great for beginners as someone is there teaching you the steps. It can save you a lot of time and fustrations when trying to meditate for the first time.</p>
  <p>Focused attention meditation is what we describe earlier on. This is where you focus on a particlar thing such as your breath. This is great for building self awareness and connecting more with your body!</p>
  <p>Visualization meditation is when you picture something or someone in your mind. With this, you are focusing on a mental image instead of the outside world or your body. This is great as you get to observe your mind and focus on any physical sensations that arise. </p>
